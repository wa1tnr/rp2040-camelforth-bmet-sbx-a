The 'make upload' target in the Makefile relies on a
link to the real mount point of RPI_RP2 that is to be
placed into the local directory.

It is named, here, as ./local-RPI_RP2 which can be any
other directory (for testing).

Example of testing (if upload is not desired):

 $ mkdir ./test.dir
 $ ln -s ./test.dir ./local-RPI_RP2
 $ make upload

END.
