NOTE: There's an error in this version of CamelForth.

The symptom: the dialog with the Forth interpreter
fails to respond (at all) and then 'catches up'
without intervention.

Seems harmless in the short term (can sometimes
continue to use it; better to simply cycle power).

Here only as a quick testing on-MCU environment
(Forth interpreter).

This is not (at all) the same UF2 meant to be built
from this (present) repository (some time in the
future).  It's a pico-sdk version of CamelForth.
