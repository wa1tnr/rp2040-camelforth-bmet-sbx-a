Each directory has a Makefile - type 'make' in that directory to build only that directory's UF2 file.

Each file is very nicely presented in well-organized code.

Reference system may've been Linux, since some executables respond to 'ldd' in Linux.  Hard to explain this, otherwise.

SEE branch 'dvlp-a' for early edits - good new edits appear there prior to branch 'main'.

There are instructions (quite terse) in the hi-flash directory (which is a renamed copy of the 'flash' directory from the upstream Author).
